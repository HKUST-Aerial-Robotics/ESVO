# ESVO: Event-based Stereo Visual Odometry

**ESVO** is a novel pipeline for real-time visual odometry using a stereo event-based camera. Both the proposed mapping and tracking methods leverage a unified event representation (Time Surfaces), thus, it could be regarded as a ''direct'', geometric method using raw event as input.

Please refer to the **[ESVO Project Page](https://sites.google.com/view/esvo-project-page/home)** for more detailed information and for testing event data.

**Please note that ESVO2 has been released!!**. You may find it at **[ESVO2](https://github.com/NAIL-HNU/ESVO2)**.

# 1. Installation

We have tested ESVO on machines with the following configurations
* Ubuntu 18.04.5 LTS + ROS melodic + gcc 5.5.0 + cmake (>=3.10) + OpenCV 3.2
* Ubuntu 16.04 LTS + ROS kinetic + gcc 5.4.0 + cmake (>=3.10) + OpenCV 3.2
* Ubuntu 20.04 LTS + ROS Noetic + OpenCV 4

For Ubuntu 16.04, you may need to upgrade your cmake.

## 1.1 Driver Installation

To work with event cameras, especially for the Dynamic Vision Sensors (DVS/DAVIS), you need to install some drivers. Please follow the instructions (steps 1-9) at [rpg_dvs_ros](https://github.com/uzh-rpg/rpg_dvs_ros) before moving on to the next step. Note that you need to replace the name of the ROS distribution with the one installed on your computer.

We use catkin tools to build the code. You should have it installed during the driver installation.

## 1.2 Dependencies Installation

You should have created a catkin workspace in Section 1.1. If not, please go back and create one.

**Clone this repository** into the `src` folder of your catkin workspace.

	$ cd ~/catkin_ws/src 
	$ git clone https://github.com/HKUST-Aerial-Robotics/ESVO.git

Dependencies are specified in the file [dependencies.yaml](dependencies.yaml). They can be installed with the following commands from the `src` folder of your catkin workspace:

	$ cd ~/catkin_ws/src
	$ sudo apt-get install python3-vcstool
	$ vcs-import < ESVO/dependencies.yaml

The previous command should clone the the repositories into folders called *catkin_simple*, *glog_catkin*, *gflags_catkin*, *minkindr*, etc. inside the `src` folder of your catking workspace, at the same level as this repository (ESVO).

You may need `autoreconf` to compile glog_catkin. To install `autoreconf`, run
    
	$ sudo apt-get install autoconf

Note that above command may change on different version of Ubuntu. 
Please refer to https://askubuntu.com/a/269423 for details.


**yaml-cpp** is only used for loading calibration parameters from yaml files:

	$ cd ~/catkin_ws/src 
	$ git clone https://github.com/jbeder/yaml-cpp.git
	$ cd yaml-cpp
	$ mkdir build && cd build && cmake -DYAML_BUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON ..
	$ make -j

Other ROS dependencies should have been installed in Section 1.1. 
If not by accident, install the missing ones accordingly.
Besides, you also need to have `OpenCV` (3.2 or later) and `Eigen 3` installed.

## 1.3 ESVO Installation

After cloning this repository, as stated above (reminder)

	$ cd ~/catkin_ws/src 
	$ git clone https://github.com/HKUST-Aerial-Robotics/ESVO.git
	
run

	$ catkin build esvo_time_surface esvo_core
	$ source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash

# 2. Usage
To run the pipeline, you need to download rosbag files from the [ESVO Project Page](https://sites.google.com/view/esvo-project-page/home).

## 2.1 esvo_time_surface
This package implements a node that constantly updates the stereo time maps (i.e., time surfaces). To launch it independently, open a terminal and run the command:

    $ roslaunch esvo_time_surface stereo_time_surface.launch
    
To play a bag file, go to `esvo_time_surface/launch/rosbag_launcher` and modify the path in 
`[bag_name].launch` according to where your rosbag file is downloaded. Then execute

    $ roslaunch esvo_time_surface [bag_name].launch
    
## 2.2 esvo_core 
This package implements the proposed mapping and tracking methods. The initialization is implemented inside the mapping part. To launch the system, run

    $ roslaunch esvo_core system_xxx.launch

This will launch two *esvo_time_surface nodes* (for left and right event cameras, respectively), the mapping node and the tracking node simultaneously. Then play the input (already downloaded) bag file by running

    $ roslaunch esvo_time_surface [bag_name].launch
    
To save trajectories at anytime, go to another terminal and terminate the system by

    $ rosparam set /ESVO_SYSTEM_STATUS "TERMINATE"
    
You need to set the path in `/cfg/tracking_xxx.yaml` to which the result file will be saved.

## 2.3 esvo_core/mvstereo
This module implements the mapper of ESVO and some other event-based mapping methods (e.g. [26], [45]).
As a multi-view stereo (MVS) pipeline, it assumes that poses are known as prior.
To launch the mapper, run

    $ roslaunch esvo_core mvstereo_xxx.launch

This will launch two *esvo_time_surface nodes* (for left and right event cameras, respectively), and the mapping node simultaneously.
Then play the input (already downloaded) bag file by running
    
    $ roslaunch esvo_time_surface [bag_name].launch

Note that only *rpg* and *upenn* datasets are applicable for this module because they come with the ground truth poses.

# 4. Notes for Good Results
Real-time performance is witnessed on a Razor Blade 15 laptop (Intel® Core™ i7-8750H CPU @ 2.20GHz × 12).
* To get real-time performance, you need a powerful PC with modern CPUs which supports at least 6 threads. 
Remember to keep you computer cool!
* The mapping and tracking are loosely coupled, which indicates that the failure of anyone will lead to bad results of the other, and hence of the whole system.
* If the initialization does not look reasonably good, reset the system by clicking the checkbox `resetButton` in the dynamic reconfigure. This checker box is used as a button. Sorry for the bad GUI design.  
* If you use a PC with limited computational resources, you could slow down the playback of the rosbag by a factor, e.g.
    
    `$ rosbag play xxx.bag -r 0.5 --clock`
    
and modify the rate of the external clock (usd for synchronizing the stereo time surfaces) accordingly, e.g.
    
    `<node name="global_timer" pkg="rostopic" type="rostopic" args="pub -s -r 50 /sync std_msgs/Time 'now' ">`
    
In this example, the bag file is played at a factor of 0.5, and thus, the synchronization signal is set to 50 Hz accordingly. These modifications must be made accordingly such that the time surface is updated (refreshed) at 100 Hz in simulation time. You can check this by running,
   
   `$ rostopic hz /TS_left`
   `$ rostopic hz /TS_right`
   
They are both supposed to be approximately 100 Hz.
* The `esvo_core` is implemented using hyper-thread techniques. Please modify the number of threads used for mapping and tracking according to your PC's capability. The parameters can be found in `include/esvo_core/tools/utils.h`.
* The `esvo_time_surface` supports hyper-thread computation. We find this may be necessary when to deal with sensors with higher resolution than that of a DAVIS346 (346 x 260). The single thread implementation takes <= 5 ms on DAVIS240C (240 x 180) and <= 10 ms on DAVIS346 (346 x 260). 
We have evaluated the double-thread version on the mentioned PC platform, which gives <= 3 ms on 240 x 180 resolution and <= 6 ms on <= 346 x 260 resolution.
* Note that ESVO is non-deterministic, namely results may be different each time you run it on the same rosbag file. This is due to stochastic operations involved in the tracking, and also, the parallelism of the system. The performance differs according to the condition of your PC, e.g. you will get better efficiency if you turn off all other running programmes.


# 5. Datasets

The event data fed to ESVO needs to be recorded at remarkbly higher streaming rate than that in the default configuration (30 Hz) of the `rpg_dvs_ros` driver. This is due to the fact that the `esvo_time_surface` operates at 100 Hz. To refresh the time surfaces with the most current events to the utmost, a notably higher streaming rate is needed (e.g., 1000 Hz). The streaming rate can be either simply set in the hardware or modified via rewriting the bag. We provide a naive example in `/rosbag_editor` to show how. 

For convenience we provide a number of bag files, which have been rewritten to meet above requirement. They can be downloaded from the [ESVO Project Page](https://sites.google.com/view/esvo-project-page/home).
